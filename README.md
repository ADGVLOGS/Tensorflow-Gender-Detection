<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Tensorflow_logo.svg">

#### Motivation
<p>People in this world cannot tell who is Male or Female. Biology has failed and Ben Shapiro has failed. <br> As a meme i decided to make a Tensorflow-Gender-Detection System to detect genders in a given image media/stream source. This could be used in RSTP, Video Files and Web-Cam video sources.</p>

#### Prerequisites 
1. You will need the following libaries that will be in requirements.txt (lightweight packages - useful packages for Heroku)
(or add a block to install your requirements like this for example) 
````
!pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. If you want GPU version of TensorFlow and other libaries. (expensive packages)
````
tensorflow
cvlib
opencv-python
````

#### Usage
##### Open up app.ipynb 
<p>The app consists of two blocks of code if im not mistaken.</p>

````
1. This is the desktop version of the application - Run the block and you will be good - Press Q to quit. 

2. This is the Flask Version (Web Version) which will run in your broswer -Run the block and you will be good.
